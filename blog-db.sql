It’s seen as a killer—a place where dreams of careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) go to die.\r\n\r\nNow the data have spoken, and their message is clear: the bad rep is justified. And the numbers are especially bleak for students who are underrepresented in STEM. Women, underrepresented minority racial and ethnic groups, individuals from low-socioeconomic-status households and students who will be the first person in their family with a four-year degree are all getting pounded in general chemistry. In some cases, they experience achievement gaps of more than half a grade point.\r\n\r\nBut gloom doesn’t have to equate to doom. The data my research group analyzed also say that if underrepresented students pass general chemistry with even an “okay” grade—in most cases, a C+ at minimum—they persist in the general chemistry sequence, and thus stay in STEM training tracks, at much higher rates than overrepresented individuals who get the same grades. When compared with their peers, the underrepresented “hyperpersist.” They show grit. And changes to how we teach can lift more underrepresented students into that hyperpersistent zone.', 4, '2020-09-18 08:26:34', 1008),
(2, 'Top 10 Internet Safety Rules & What Not to Do Online', 'http://placeimg.com/640/360/any', 'A 19-year-old running for public office in New Hampshire found out about the importance of following Internet safety rules the hard way. As Seacoast Online reports, his opponents found images in his social media posts that were sexually suggestive and referenced past drug use. Just like that, his political career crashed and burned upon takeoff. But, unfortunately, he isn\'t the only one, as careless Internet habits have left others exposed to scams, identity theft and physical harm at the hands of people they met online. With more users accessing the Internet through mobile devices, these risks are changing and growing quickly.\r\n\r\nEven though apps loom larger in most people\'s daily online interactions than traditional websites do, that does not mean that the basic Internet safety rules have changed. Hackers are still on the lookout for personal information they can use to access your credit card and bank information.\r\n\r\nUnsafe surfing can also lead to other threats—from embarrassing personal comments or images that, once online, are nearly impossible to erase, to getting mixed up with people you\'d rather have had nothing to do with.\r\n\r\nHere are the Top 10 Internet safety rules to follow to help you avoid getting into trouble online (and offline).\r\n\r\n1. Keep Personal Information Professional and Limited\r\nPotential employers or customers don\'t need to know your personal relationship status or your home address. They do need to know about your expertise and professional background, and how to get in touch with you. You wouldn\'t hand purely personal information out to strangers individually—don\'t hand it out to millions of people online.\r\n\r\n2. Keep Your Privacy Settings On\r\nMarketers love to know all about you, and so do hackers. Both can learn a lot from your browsing and social media usage. But you can take charge of your information. As noted by Lifehacker, both web browsers and mobile operating systems have settings available to protect your privacy online. Major websites like Facebook also have privacy-enhancing settings available. These settings are sometimes (deliberately) hard to find because companies want your personal information for its marketing value. Make sure you have enabled these privacy safeguards, and keep them enabled.\r\n\r\n3. Practice Safe Browsing\r\nYou wouldn\'t choose to walk through a dangerous neighborhood—don\'t visit dangerous neighborhoods online. Cybercriminals use lurid content as bait. They know people are sometimes tempted by dubious content and may let their guard down when searching for it. The Internet\'s demimonde is filled with hard-to-see pitfalls, where one careless click could expose personal data or infect your device with malware. By resisting the urge, you don\'t even give the hackers a chance.\r\n\r\n4. Make Sure Your Internet Connection is Secure. Use a Secure VPN Connection\r\nWhen you go online in a public place, for example by using a public Wi-Fi connection, PCMag notes you have no direct control over its security. Corporate cybersecurity experts worry about \"endpoints\"—the places where a private network connects to the outside world. Your vulnerable endpoint is your local Internet connection. Make sure your device is secure, and when in doubt, wait for a better time (i.e., until you\'re able to connect to a secure Wi-Fi network) before providing information such as your bank account number.\r\n\r\nTo further improve your Internet browsing safety, use secure VPN connection (virtual private network). VPN enables you to have a secure connection between your device and an Internet server that no one can monitor or access the data that you’re exchanging. Read more about What is VPN\r\n\r\n5. Be Careful What You Download\r\nA top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. As PCWorld advises, don\'t download apps that look suspicious or come from a site you don\'t trust.\r\n\r\n6. Choose Strong Passwords\r\nPasswords are one of the biggest weak spots in the whole Internet security structure, but there\'s currently no way around them. And the problem with passwords is that people tend to choose easy ones to remember (such as \"password\" and \"123456\"), which are also easy for cyber thieves to guess. Select strong passwords that are harder for cybercriminals to demystify. Password manager software can help you to manage multiple passwords so that you don\'t forget them. A strong password is one that is unique and complex—at least 15 characters long, mixing letters, numbers and special characters.\r\n\r\n7. Make Online Purchases From Secure Sites\r\nAny time you make a purchase online, you need to provide credit card or bank account information—just what cybercriminals are most eager to get their hands on. Only supply this information to sites that provide secure, encrypted connections. As Boston University notes, you can identify secure sites by looking for an address that starts with https: (the S stands for secure) rather than simply http: They may also be marked by a padlock icon next to the address bar.\r\n\r\n8. Be Careful What You Post\r\nThe Internet does not have a delete key, as that young candidate in New Hampshire found out. Any comment or image you post online may stay online forever because removing the original (say, from Twitter) does not remove any copies that other people made. There is no way for you to \"take back\" a remark you wish you hadn\'t made, or get rid of that embarrassing selfie you took at a party. Don\'t put anything online that you wouldn\'t want your mom or a prospective employer to see.\r\n\r\n9. Be Careful Who You Meet Online\r\nPeople you meet online are not always who they claim to be. Indeed, they may not even be real. As InfoWorld reports, fake social media profiles are a popular way for hackers to cozy up to unwary Web users and pick their cyber pockets. Be as cautious and sensible in your online social life as you are in your in-person social life.\r\n\r\n10. Keep Your Antivirus Program Up To Date\r\nInternet security software cannot protect against every threat, but it will detect and remove most malware—though you should make sure it\'s to date. Be sure to stay current with your operating system\'s updates and updates to applications you use. They provide a vital layer of security.\r\n\r\nKeep these 10 basic Internet safety rules in mind and you\'ll avoid many of the nasty surprises that lurk online for the careless.', 2, '2020-09-18 08:21:34', 65),

It’s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music.” Most of us would wholeheartedly agree with this statement, and it is this universal bond with music that has led researchers across the globe to investigate its therapeutic potential.\r\n\r\n“We have a such a deep connection to music because it is ‘hardwired’ in our brains and bodies,” said Barbara Else.\r\nWe can all think of at least one song that, when we hear it, triggers an emotional response. It might be a song that accompanied the first dance at your wedding, for example, or a song that reminds you of a difficult break-up or the loss of a loved one.\r\n\r\n“We have a such a deep connection to music because it is ‘hardwired’ in our brains and bodies,” Barbara Else, senior advisor of policy and research at the American Music Therapy Association told Medical News Today. “The elements of music – rhythm, melody, etc. – are echoed in our physiology, functioning and being.”\r\n\r\nGiven the deep connection we have with music, it is perhaps unsurprising that numerous studies have shown it can benefit our mental health. A 2011 study by researchers from McGill University in Canada found that listening to music increases the amount of dopamine produced in the brain – a mood-enhancing chemical, making it a feasible treatment for depression.\r\n\r\nAnd earlier this year, MNT reported on a study published in The Lancet Psychiatry that suggested listening to hip-hop music – particularly that from Kendrick Lamar – may help individuals to understand mental health disorders.\r\n\r\nBut increasingly, researchers are finding that the health benefits of music may go beyond mental health, and as a result, some health experts are calling for music therapy to be more widely incorporated into health care settings.\r\n\r\nIn this Spotlight, we take a closer look at some of the potential health benefits of music and look at whether, for some conditions, music could be used to improve – or even replace – current treatment strategies.\r\n\r\n', 3, '2020-09-18 08:34:17', 26),

Problems occur when those mechanisms fail. Even under powerful attacks from the immune system, cancers routinely fight back. Genetic alterations help the disease evade the immune system, and cancer cells can alter the local immune response.\r\n\r\nThat devious adaptability can lower responsiveness to therapies, and is why the efficacy of treatments can dwindle over time. To overcome that, scientists are investigating a collection of new therapeutic approaches that release cancer’s hold on the immune system and enhance a patient’s natural immune response, just as injections of bacteria did for Coley’s patient. The results could open a new front in the fight against cancer.', 4, '2020-09-18 07:34:43', 6),

My daily art project has helped me to explore my artistic style and learn the practice of coding in a playful way. When I started the project it was a challenge to come up with something each day and publish it online. Now it’s simply a part of my daily life.\r\n\r\nTime spent on my “daily” is a time during which I’m free to explore and be creative. When things get boring, I know I need to challenge myself again in order to create something fresh and different. I’m happy to share my thoughts and experience, and hope to yield the inspiration you need to start similar projects of your own.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\nSo how did I end up so deep down this rabbit hole of making pieces of art on a daily basis?\r\n\r\nDuring my studies, I was introduced to programming but didn’t have the time to understand it well enough. Not because I was lazy, I believe, but because I excelled in design much more so than in code. However, a desire to understand how to code visual artworks stayed with me after I graduated.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, I began a quest to get back into exploring my artistic practice. As my education in graphic and interaction design was more focused on creating meaningful experiences, I wanted to explore more freely and still use the design knowledge I had learned. I started exploring the creation of generative patterns, grid-based artworks and animations.\r\n\r\nIt was scary to retake the first steps into exploring how to code, as I was convinced It might just be too hard for me to learn. You should not let your past experience lessen your desire to learn.\r\n\r\nDuring my quest for subjects I wanted to explore I came across the “HYPE Framework”, and a SkillShare class by designer Joshua Davis. This got me into making generative patterns; it was the right combination of using my skills in making shapes in Illustrator and using a framework to learn how code works. When you’re starting out, finding something to learn that combines with a skill you already have makes it easier to achieve the desired result.\r\n\r\nOVERCOMING PERFECTIONISM\r\nIt was during that time that I started making animations with grid-based drawing software “Hexels”, sometimes combining shapes I created with Hexels to use with the HYPE Framework. I was happy exploring and being creative with the tools I was learning. Only one dreaded factor was holding me back: perfectionism. The works I was creating were never “good enough” to show to other people. This is what made me challenge myself to start my “daily” experiment; I would create one artwork each day for one month and upload it to my Tumblr blog.', 1, '2020-09-29 17:19:38', 456),

Diversity and inclusivity will make music more interesting - Self Esteem, musician\r\n\r\nI don\'t want to be a novelty anymore\r\n\"I think female-made music will hopefully be considered as simply \'music\'. I\'m hopeful in thinking, for instance, that festival line-ups will become more diverse and inclusive - without waving the flag and bellowing that their USP is, \'Women make up X amount of the acts performing!\' I think, surely, it will become that this isn\'t a thing to be praised or a woke selling-point, but more the status quo.\r\n\r\n\"If this isn\'t the way things are heading we stand to create a boring, less creative playing field where people continue to use women as a tool, a novelty. I want to be booked, reviewed well and respected because I am a good ARTIST.\"\r\n\r\n2. UK rap and drill will dominate - Kenny Allstar, BBC 1Xtra DJ\r\n\r\nChart success for UK underground music will become more common\r\n\"2018 was an amazing year in terms of chart success for UK rap music. Dave and Fredo\'s Funky Friday went to No.1 and drill records like Unknown T\'s Homerton B and Dig Dat\'s Air Force reached the Top 40, with many more UK street anthems breaking into the charts.\r\n\r\n\"This will become more common in 2019, especially with albums like AJ Tracey\'s debut likely to do major numbers. We\'re also expecting big projects from the likes of Nines, Aitch and more. There\'s also a surge in dance-led drill music, which is taking the sting out of the stereotypes of the genre and shining it in a much funner light.\"\r\n\r\n3. Albums will get even longer - Charlotte Gunn, NME editor\r\n\r\nWill Yandhi end up being Kanye\'s Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness? Let\'s hope not\r\n\"Albums will continue to get longer in 2019. In one of the last significant releases of 2018, ZAYN followed the trend of bloated releases and dropped a 27-track record - that\'s 1 hour and 28 minutes of Zayn Malik - much to his fans\' delight.\r\n\r\n\"In this current climate, long albums do numbers and unless we see a dramatic change in the way that streaming contributes to the charts, this trend is going nowhere. Nicki Minaj, in a desperate bid to beat Travis Scott to No.1, was furiously adding tracks to her record after its release.\r\n\r\n\"Will Yandhi end up being Kanye\'s Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness? Let\'s hope not.\"\r\n\r\n4. Music will be truly global - Joe Muggs, music journalist\r\n\r\nIf you want the newest, strangest, most vivid developments in music, look not to New York or London, but to Kinshasa or Kuala Lumpur!\r\n\"There\'s a big world out there.

The connectivity of the internet was already making music from all over the world - not \'world music\' in the sense that usually signifies traditional sounds, but modern pop - readily available. But the shift to streaming has sped this up exponentially; and in particular, huge hits in particular regions of the world will spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\n\"But this isn\'t just about the next Gangnam Style or Despacito, it applies all the way down into the underground. In electronic music, not only are a generation of stars rising from Siberia to Seoul, Capetown to Caracas, but labels and collectives are coming up specifically to forge international bonds. We have seen NON Worldwide, an \'African diasporic\' label and community, the Chinabot imprint showcasing artists of East Asian descent, Bedouin fusing experimental electronics with the music of the Arab world, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"This diversification and hybridisation is only increasing.

The need to think on the move and make decisions when physically exhausted is something that appeals to adventure racers over other sports such as triathlon where you simply ‘get your head down and race’.\r\n\r\nThe adrenaline rush that comes from adventure racing is another reason why people are attracted to the sport.\r\n\r\nOnce you try adventure racing, the biggest kick of all will be discovering a whole side to yourself you never knew existed and you will amaze yourself at how much you can achieve.\r\n\r\nAnother great attraction about adventure racing is that competitors unable to succeed in a purely physical event such as cross-country running can equal, or even beat, physically stronger athletes through the use of their navigation skills, race planning and decision making.\r\n\r\nWho can do adventure racing?\r\nAlmost anyone can try adventure racing - you don’t need any experience to get started.

The location therefore determines what kind of country you would expect to find at that point.\r\n\r\nThe same seems to apply to the brain. Every network is located at a certain place, which determines its function and neighbors but also the kind of function that occurs there. However, the rules that describe the relationships different brain regions have to each-other were not well understood until now. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and the Forschungszentrum Juelich, together with an international team of collaborators, have deciphered two axes along which the human brain is organized. It was found that these axes are mainly determined by genetic factors.\r\n\r\nOne axis stretches from the posterior (back) to the frontal part of the cortex. This reflects a functional hierarchy from basic capabilities such as vision and movement to abstract, highly complex skills such as cognition, memory, and social skills. A second axis leads from the dorsal (upper) to the ventral (lower) part of the cortex. Whereas the ventral system has been associated with functions assigning meaning and motivation, the dorsal system may relate to space, time, and movement.\r\n\r\n\"Interestingly, this vertical arrangement aligns with the long-held hypothesis of dual origin,\" says Sofie Valk, research group leader at the MPI CBS and Forschungszentrum Juelich and first author of the study, published in Science Advances. According to this hypothesis, the cerebral cortex developed from two different origins, the amygdala and olfactory cortex on the one hand and the hippocampus on the other hand. From these origins two different lines of cortical development arose, reflecting waves from less to more differentiated areas starting at each origin.

Majority of the companies understand the importance of a good user interaction on the Website and its impact on customer engagement, especially on mobile devices. Web design mainly consists of a good design layout, a consistent and easy visual movement, and a good interaction. Navigation and responsive menus are a major part of Web design and an area of huge focus from design as well as coding perspective.\r\n\r\nWhat are Responsive Menus?\r\nResponsive menus are designed and coded in such a way that the basic layout of a web page or website can fit into different screen sizes, across mobile devices. With the availability of several advanced gadgets and electronic devices, it has become important for brands to be accessible across a variety of gadgets with different screen sizes. Take for example the screen sizes of a Windows laptop, a MacBook, an android phone or an iPhone, and how varied their sizes are. While designing a webpage, all these screen sizes must be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nA webpage on a laptop screen should be designed differently to fit in a phone\'s screen, due to size constraints, and the way of interaction should also be modified (i.e., mouse on a laptop vs. touch on a mobile device). This is why these menus are used. A different device calls for a different form of interaction and display, and a designer\'s job is always to ensure comfortable interaction between an interface and the user. If the size and navigation of the devices are altered, the design and web layout must also be altered to provide the best user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy Use Responsive Menus?\r\nWeb design isn\'t just a tool for aesthetics and superior visual placement. It highlights and upholds a company\'s values, branding, and its concern towards its users. The better the interaction between customers and a company, the better a company will perform. A good web design allows customers to navigate a particular website with ease, and find what they were looking for on a website quickly. Some of the major design benefits of responsive menus are -\r\n\r\nEnsures great user experience; if customers are impressed with the company\'s website and have a good experience navigating through it, they will visit it more often and will also recommend it to others, resulting in an increase in the traffic\r\nSimple adjustments to these menus can ensure superior design layout with enhanced appearance and easier navigation\r\nUse of responsive menus in mobile sites ensures better ergonomic and allow users to operate large websites with a thumb', 1, '2020-09-28 18:33:02', 89),

Although not a new technology per se, this computing model is now making it easier to deliver computing resources to businesses worldwide, and at a fraction of their existing costs. Today, the computing needs of a company have reduced exponentially owing to automation, and the internet-powered cloud migration strategy is already helping countless businesses worldwide make smooth transitions.\r\n\r\nWith 10% of the companies with over 1000 employees projected to spend more than $10M on cloud migration in the US alone, we know that the rapid adoption of cloud technology is not really far away. By 2018 typical IT departments within a typical company will have very few platforms (40%) residing in on premise systems, while letting the cloud take care of all the hard work. Today, many companies have started their journey towards an integrated cloud environment by migrating their existing systems, apps, services, and data to the cloud.\r\n\r\nWhat is Cloud Migration?\r\nIn the simplest of terms, cloud migration involves the process of moving relevant business data, applications, and other important elements of an organization from its desktops and servers to the cloud. This process can sometimes also entail moving data between different cloud environments provided by different service providers based upon their area of expertise.\r\n\r\nCloud migration makes cloud computing possible, wherein the cloud performs all the computing that was earlier performed by mobile devices, laptops, or desktops. The benefits of cloud computing are many, as most of the background processing is now conducted at large, secure data centers thereby saving valuable company resources. At the same time, cloud migration challenges are still an important reality that many companies wake up to unless they partner with an experienced service provider.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 basic types of cloud to which cloud migration can take place, and service providers offer their services accordingly.
